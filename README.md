# Emacs Klondike

Klondike solitaire for Emacs

## How to Download/Install
This package is on [Melpa](https://melpa.org/#/klondike); you can
install it by running `M-x list-packages` in Emacs and searching for
`klondike`, if you have the Melpa repository loaded by `Package`. If you
don't have the repository added – yet –, you can find instructions for
how to add it at the [Melpa
Github page](https://github.com/melpa/melpa#usage).

If you don't want to use either Melpa or Emacs's package manager… [add
this info., later…]
