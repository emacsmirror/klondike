* Emacs Klondike
  :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: emacs-klondike
  :END:
Klondike solitaire for Emacs

** How to Download/Install
   :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-download_install
   :END:
This package is on [[https://melpa.org/#/klondike][Melpa]]; you can
install it by running =M-x list-packages= in Emacs and searching for
=klondike=, if you have the Melpa repository loaded by =Package=. If you
don't have the repository added – yet –, you can find instructions for
how to add it at the [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa#usage][Melpa
Github page]].

** How to Use
   :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-use
   :END:
You can launch a game by running =M-x klondike=; if a game is already
running, its buffer will be brought to the forefront.

A new game will look like so:
[[./2023-02-14T16:02:05,946226379-06:00.png]]

To select any of the bottom 7 rows, press any key =1=–=7=.

To select any of the top-right stacks, press =!=, =@=, =#=, or =$=
(from left, to right).

To select any face-up cards moved from the face-down stack (in the
top-left corner of the screen), press =0=.

If multiple cards are available to move, the visible portion of the
stack will be numbered so that you can specify the depth of the stack
you want to move:
[[./2023-02-14T16:27:21,058570768-06:00.png]]

You can select a particular number using the function keys; using
=F2=, we should get:
[[./2023-02-14T16:35:14,119336525-06:00.png]]

This will move the 4 of spades and any cards which reside on top of
it. If there is only one card face-up on any stack, that card will be
selected automatically.

To move the card(s) you've selected, use the same key-bindings
which're used to pick a stack to select cards from (except for =0=;
you cannot move cards to this area other than from the face-down
stack).

There are three shortcuts, given their frequency of use: in lieu of
using the function keys
- selecting one of the bottom-row stacks (keys =1=–=7=) will attempt
  to move all visible cards of your picked stack to the new stack
  you've selected
- selecting one of the top-right stacks (keys =!=, =@=, =#=, and =$=,
  from left, to right) will attempt to move the top-most visible card
  of your picked stack to the top-right stack you've selected
- =TAB= will check if any of the top-right stacks are able to accept
  the top-most visible card of your picked stack; if you can move this
  top-most visible card to any of them, it will get moved
  automatically, for you

/Finally/, – to flip a card from the face-down stack to face-up – use
=SPC=.

*** Reassigning Key-bindings
    :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: reassigning-key–bindings
    :END:
There are, essentially, three major modes that Klondike can exist in,
covered (informally) above:
- [[file:klondike.el::1271][klondike-mode]] (the initial mode you
  enter upon any Klondike game)
- [[file:klondike.el::1336][klondike-picker-mode]] (the mode the game
  uses when picking a card depth from the visible cards of a
  particular stack)
- [[file:klondike.el::1379][klondike-select-mode]] (the mode the game
  uses when you are selecting a stack to move your picked cards to)

Their bindings are laid out, below, for each mode; to redefine any
key-binding, use ~define-key~ and the mode-map of the respective mode
and the function/~lambda~ specified by the tables, below.
