   :END:
This package is on [[https://melpa.org/#/klondike][Melpa]]; you can
install it by running =M-x list-packages= in Emacs and searching for
=klondike=, if you have the Melpa repository loaded by =Package=. If you
don't have the repository added – yet –, you can find instructions for
how to add it at the [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa#usage][Melpa
Github page]].

** How to Use

You can launch a game by running =M-x klondike=; if a game is already
running, its buffer will be brought to the forefront.

A new game will look like so:
[[./2023-02-14T16:02:05,946226379-06:00.png]]

To select any of the bottom 7 rows, press any key =1=–=7=.

To select any of the top-right stacks, press =!=, =@=, =#=, or =$=
(from left, to right).

To select any face-up cards moved from the face-down stack (in the
top-left corner of the screen), press =0=.

If multiple cards are available to move, the visible portion of the
stack will be numbered so that you can specify the depth of the stack
you want to move:
[[./2023-02-14T16:27:21,058570768-06:00.png]]

You can select a particular number using the function keys; using
=F2=, we should get:
[[./2023-02-14T16:35:14,119336525-06:00.png]]

This will move the 4 of spades and any cards which reside on top of
it. If there is only one card face-up on any stack, that card will be
selected automatically.

To move the card(s) you've selected, use the same key-bindings
which're used to pick a stack to select cards from (except for =0=;
you cannot move cards to this area other than from the face-down
stack).
