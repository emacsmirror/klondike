This package is on [[https://melpa.org/#/klondike][Melpa]]; you can
install it by running =M-x list-packages= in Emacs and searching for
=klondike=, if you have the Melpa repository loaded by =Package=. If you
don't have the repository added – yet –, you can find instructions for
how to add it at the [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa#usage][Melpa
Github page]].

If you don't want to use either Melpa or Emacs's package manager… [add
this info., later…]
